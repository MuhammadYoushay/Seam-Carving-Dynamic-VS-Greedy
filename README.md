# Seam-Carving-Dynamic-VS-Greedy
Balancing Act: Exploring the Trade-offs Between Dynamic Programming and Greedy Approaches in Seam Carving, with Insights into Seam Insertion Techniques
This paper presents a novel comparative analysis between dynamic programming and greedy algorithms for content-aware image resizing through seam carving. Dynamic programming offers global optimization but is computationally expensive, while the greedy approach prioritizes speed over accuracy. Through extensive testing, we highlight the significant performance gains of the greedy technique but identify scenarios where dynamic programming preserves visual quality better. We explore limitations with high-frequency content and conduct comparative assessments of seam insertion methodologies for content-aware expansion. The findings offer insights for algorithm selection, supported by visual outputs, and timing measurements. This work contributes to advancing intelligent image resizing methodologies.
